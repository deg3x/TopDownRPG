# TopDownRPG

This is a (wannabe) infinite top-down dungeon crawler, combining elements of
classic top-down hack-n-slash RPGs with modern rogue-like design ideas.

It's a hobby project that I work in my free time and, hence, it progresses kinda slowly.

_This project uses **KayKit** 3D assets created by the talented [Kay Lousberg][1]:_
